# Intro

This project is used to get a better understanding of how AI works by applying some of the concepts in on a very fundamental level using pytorch and the provided tutorials.

I am using this repository to collect some concepts and later on realize some initial project ideas like an object detector for my webcam.


# Knowledge

I also want to share some insights and understandings I made during the learning process.

## Deep Learning

Why deep learning? Currently we do just hear GenAI or AI, but what we do not hear is Deep Learning. For me it is kind of the same thing as with Bitcoin, we hear about the representation of a technology, but not the actual concepts and technologies under the hood (blockchain).



# Reading Collection

I also want to collect some helpful resources for learning more about AI.
